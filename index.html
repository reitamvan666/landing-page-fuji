          Japan’s Mt. Fuji is an active volcano about 100 kilometers southwest
          of Tokyo. Commonly called “Fuji-san,” it’s the country’s tallest peak,
          at 3,776 meters. A pilgrimage site for centuries, it’s considered one
          of Japan’s 3 sacred mountains, and summit hikes remain a popular
          activity. Its iconic profile is the subject of numerous works of art,
          notably Edo Period prints by Hokusai and Hiroshige.

          Mount Fuji (富士山, Fujisan), or Fugaku, located on the island of
          Honshū, is the highest mountain in Japan, standing 3,776.24 m
          (12,389.2 ft). It is the second-highest volcano located on an island
          in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and
          seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth. Mount Fuji is an active
          stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707 to 1708. The mountain is
          located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo and is visible from
          there on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone,
          which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is
          commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently
          depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers and
          climbers. Mount Fuji is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains" (三霊山,
          Sanreizan) along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a Special Place
          of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites. It was added to
          the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013. According
          to UNESCO, Mount Fuji has "inspired artists and poets and been the
          object of pilgrimage for centuries". UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of
          cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations
          include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, Fujisan Hongū Sengen
          Taisha.

          The current kanji for Mount Fuji, 富 and 士, mean "wealth" or
          "abundant" and "man of status" respectively. However, the origins of
          this spelling and of the name Fuji continue to be debated. A text of
          the 9th century, Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, says that the name came
          from "immortal" (不死, fushi, fuji) and also from the image of
          abundant (富, fu) soldiers (士, shi, ji) ascending the slopes of the
          mountain. An early folk etymology claims that Fuji came from 不二 (not
          + two), meaning without equal or nonpareil. Another claims that it
          came from 不盡 (not + to exhaust), meaning never-ending. Hirata
          Atsutane, a Japanese classical scholar in the Edo period, speculated
          that the name is from a word meaning, "a mountain standing up shapely
          as an ear (穗, ho) of a rice plant". British missionary John Batchelor
          (1854–1944) argued that the name is from the Ainu word for "fire"
          (fuchi) of the fire deity Kamui Fuchi, which was denied by a Japanese
          linguist Kyōsuke Kindaichi on the grounds of phonetic development
          (sound change). It is also pointed out that huchi means an "old woman"
          and ape is the word for "fire", ape huchi kamuy being the fire deity.
          Research on the distribution of place names that include fuji as a
          part also suggest the origin of the word fuji is in the Yamato
          language rather than Ainu. Japanese toponymist Kanji Kagami argued
          that the name has the same root as wisteria (藤, fuji) and rainbow
          (虹, niji, but with an alternative reading, fuji), and came from its
          "long well-shaped slope".

          Mount Fuji is an attractive volcanic cone and a frequent subject of
          Japanese art especially after 1600, when Edo (now Tokyo) became the
          capital and people saw the mountain while traveling on the Tōkaidō
          road. According to the historian H. Byron Earhart, "in medieval times
          it eventually came to be seen by Japanese as the “number one” mountain
          of the known world of the three countries of India, China, and Japan".
          The mountain is mentioned in Japanese literature throughout the ages
          and is the subject of many poems. The summit has been thought of as
          sacred since ancient times and was therefore forbidden to women. It
          was not until 1872 that the Japanese government issued an edict (May
          4, 1872, Grand Council of State Edict 98) stating, "Any remaining
          practices of female exclusion on shrine and temple lands shall be
          immediately abolished, and mountain climbing for the purpose of
          worship, etc., shall be permitted.” However, Tatsu Takayama (also
          known as Takayama Tatsu), a Japanese woman, became the first woman on
          record to summit Mount Fuji in the fall of 1832. Ancient samurai used
          the base of the mountain as a remote training area, near the
          present-day town of Gotemba. The shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo held
          yabusame archery contests in the area in the early Kamakura period.
          The first ascent by a foreigner was by Sir Rutherford Alcock in
          September 1860, who ascended the mountain in 8 hours and descended in
          3 hours.: 427  Alcock's brief narrative in The Capital of the Tycoon
          was the first widely disseminated description of the mountain in the
          West.: 421–27  Lady Fanny Parkes, the wife of British ambassador Sir
          Harry Parkes, was the first non-Japanese woman to ascend Mount Fuji in
          1867. Photographer Felix Beato climbed Mount Fuji two years later. On
          March 5, 1966, BOAC Flight 911, a Boeing 707, broke up in flight and
          crashed near the Mount Fuji Gotemba New fifth station, shortly after
          departure from Tokyo International Airport. All 113 passengers and 11
          crew members died in the disaster, which was attributed to the extreme
          clear-air turbulence caused by lee waves downwind of the mountain.
          There is a memorial for the crash a short distance down from the
          Gotemba New fifth station. Today, Mount Fuji is an international
          destination for tourism and mountain climbing. In the early 20th
          century, populist educator Frederick Starr's Chautauqua lectures about
          his several ascents of Mount Fuji—1913, 1919, and 1923—were widely
          known in America. A well-known Japanese saying suggests that a wise
          person will climb Mt. Fuji once in their lifetime, but only a fool
          would climb it twice. It remains a popular symbol in Japanese culture,
          including making numerous movie appearances, inspiring the Infiniti
          logo, and even appearing in medicine with the Mount Fuji sign. In
          September 2004, the staffed weather station at the summit was closed
          after 72 years in operation. Observers monitored radar sweeps that
          detected typhoons and heavy rains. The station, which was the highest
          in Japan at 3,780 metres (12,402 ft), was replaced by a fully
          automated meteorological system. Mount Fuji was added to the World
          Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.

          Approximately 300,000 people climbed Mount Fuji in 2009. The most
          popular period for people to hike up Mount Fuji is from July to
          August, while huts and other facilities are operating and the weather
          is warmest. Buses to the trail heads typically used by climbers start
          running on July 1. Climbing from October to May is very strongly
          discouraged, after a number of high-profile deaths and severe cold
          weather. Most Japanese climb the mountain at night in order to be in a
          position at or near the summit when the sun rises. The morning light
          is called 御来光 goraikō, "arrival of light". There are four major
          routes to the summit, each has numbered stations along the way. They
          are (clockwise, starting North): Kawaguchiko, Subashiri, Gotemba, and
          Fujinomiya routes. Climbers usually start at the fifth stations, as
          these are reachable by car or by bus. The summit is the tenth station
          on each trail. The stations on different routes are at different
          elevations; the highest fifth station is located at Fujinomiya,
          followed by Yoshida, Subashiri, and Gotemba. There are four additional
          routes from the foot of the mountain: Shojiko, Yoshida, Suyama, and
          Murayama routes.[citation needed] Even though it has only the
          second-highest fifth stations, the Yoshida route is the most-popular
          route because of its large parking area and many large mountain huts
          where a climber can rest or stay. During the summer season, most Mount
          Fuji climbing tour buses arrive there. The next-popular is the
          Fujinomiya route, which has the highest fifth station, followed by
          Subashiri and Gotemba. The ascent from the new fifth station can take
          anywhere between five and seven hours while the descent can take from
          three to four hours. Even though most climbers do not climb the
          Subashiri and Gotemba routes, many descend these because of their
          ash-covered paths. From the seventh station to near the fifth station,
          one could run down these ash-covered paths in approximately 30
          minutes. Besides these routes, there are tractor routes along the
          climbing routes. These tractor routes are used to bring food and other
          materials to huts on the mountain. Because the tractors usually take
          up most of the width of these paths and they tend to push large rocks
          from the side of the path, the tractor paths are off-limits to the
          climbers on sections that are not merged with the climbing or
          descending paths. Nevertheless, one can sometimes see people riding
          mountain bikes along the tractor routes down from the summit. This is
          particularly risky, as it becomes difficult to control speed and may
          send some rocks rolling along the side of the path, which may hit
          other people. The four routes from the foot of the mountain offer
          historical sites. The Murayama is the oldest Mount Fuji route and the
          Yoshida route still has many old shrines, teahouses, and huts along
          its path. These routes are gaining popularity recently and are being
          restored, but climbing from the foot of the mountain is still
          relatively uncommon. Also, bears have been sighted along the Yoshida
          route. Huts at and above the fifth stations are usually staffed during
          the climbing season, but huts below fifth stations are not usually
          staffed for climbers. The number of open huts on routes are
          proportional to the number of climbers—Yoshida has the most while
          Gotemba has the fewest. The huts along the Gotemba route also tend to
          start later and close earlier than those along the Yoshida route.
          Also, because Mount Fuji is designated as a national park, it is
          illegal to camp above the fifth station. There are eight peaks around
          the crater at the summit. The highest point in Japan, Ken-ga-mine, is
          where the Mount Fuji Radar System used to be (it was replaced by an
          automated system in 2004). Climbers are able to visit each of these
          peaks.
